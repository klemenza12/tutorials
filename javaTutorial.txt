if we want to use the build in database "java  db"
we need to copy the file from cd /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_17/db/lib/derby.jar
to a directory cd /usr/lib/java-1.8.0/ 
than we need to iclude it in eclipse
we will find also in this directory mysql-connector-java-5.1.39-bin.jar
which had to be included also if we want to use mysql library
